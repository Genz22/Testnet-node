## Setup and Run a Stratos-chain Full node

Stratos blockchain facilitates all decentralized ledger transactions and functionalities, providing settlement services and related financial payment services for network providers and network users in an efficient, fair and transparent manner.

The Stratos-chain full-nodes are dedicated servers with sufficient computing power that participate in block generation cycle. It is necessary in order to be a validator.

In practice, running a full-node only implies running a non-compromised and up-to-date version of the software with low network latency and without downtime. It is encouraged to run a full-node even if you do not plan to be a validator.

The Stratos-chain validator is a full-node that participates in the Stratos Chain block generation cycle and also voting for the validity of a block proposed.
