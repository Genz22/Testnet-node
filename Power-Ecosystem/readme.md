# PARTICIPANT IN DeInfra Testnet

Powerians 🖐

Today we’re launching our Community bot who called itself Power Rover and putting you in its hands 🚀

Initially, we planned to do a pre-selection. 
But we got so many applications that it turned out that in the Phase I at the moment for each node more than 20 people have applied ‼️
Furthermore, we did not expect that so many really experienced testneters would come to us 🫶

So we decided to make it this way: all applicants will have an equal opportunity. 
Each of you will have the opportunity to pass the verification via Power Rover and then challenge yourself in the test assignment 👊

The most important thing. This is Rover’s home address: https://t.me/thepowerio_bot
